=head2 startService

"Start" ipset by generating sets

=cut

sub startService {
    my ( $self ) = @_;

    # Saving existing system sets
    pf::ipset::save() unless ($self->runningServices);

    # Flushing currently configured sets
    pf::ipset::flush();

    # Generating and applying PacketFence sets
    pf::ipset::restore(pf::ipset::generate());

    # Populate inline related sets
    # TODO: This is go into pf::enforcement::inline or related...
    pf::ipset::populate_inline if pf::config::is_inline_enforcement_enabled();

    # Since ipset is not a running service, it doesn't have a PID associated to it.
    # We use -1 as a PID for theses kind of "services"
    open (my $fh, '>>' . $self->pidFile);
    print $fh "-1";
    close ($fh);

    return 1;
}

=head2 stop

"Stop" ipset by flushing sets

=cut

sub stop {
    my ( $self ) = @_;

    # Flushing PacketFence sets
    pf::ipset::flush();

    # Restoring previously configured (system?) sets
    pf::ipset::restore();

    unlink $self->pidFile;

    return 1;
}

=head2 isAlive

Check if ipset is "alive"
Since it is never really stopped then we check if sets are defined and if the fake PID exists

=cut

sub isAlive {
    my ( $self, $pid ) = @_;

    $pid = $self->pid;
    my $running = pf::ipset::check();

    return ( defined($pid) && $running );
